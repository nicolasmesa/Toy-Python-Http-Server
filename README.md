# Nick's Python HTTP Server

This is a toy server that I created in less than 1.5 hours. I wanted to see how far I could go with it. It still has some bugs but has basic functionality. It is also vulnerable to pretty much everyting  (../../../../etc/passwd comes to mind).

## TODO

* Add multi-threading support
* Infer content-type based on file extension?
* Fix bug: sometimes the connection hangs while reading from the socket
